# TECH-TEST
Write a code to print out all the numbers between 1 and 100, one on each line.... # with a few exceptions:

- When the number is divisible by 7, the program should print "Foo" instead of the number
- When the number is divisible by 5, the program should print "Bar" instead of the number
- When the number is divisible by both 5 and 7, it should print "FooBar" instead of the number
- When the number is divisible by 56, the program should skip it entirely

The output format should be HTML but the code should be PHP.

Put you answer in a github gist and share the link with me
